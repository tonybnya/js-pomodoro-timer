# JS Pomodoro Timer

According to Wikipedia, the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method
developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length,
separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro.

## Description

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer to 25 minutes.
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break of 5 minutes.
5. After the fourth pomodoro, take a long break of 20 minutes.
   Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

NB:
a pomodoro is a sequence of work for 25 min, following by a short break of 5 min.
